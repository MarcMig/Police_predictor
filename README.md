# Police_predictor

Can we predict the outcome of a Police intervention?

We're looking at Street level crime data in London gleaned from [data.police.uk](data.police.uk) for 2020.

As a Data-Science exercise we'll build a classifier to try and predict the outcome of a Police intervention being investigated or going to court and see if it yields any insights.
